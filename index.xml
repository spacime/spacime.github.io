      <description>Search I use the commercial search function, which is easy to make it realized. Add search function is very useful, beacuse user in the internet has develop the habit of searching in the website. And it is also a good way to attract user stay on the website for long time.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kbengine&#34;&gt;KBEngine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a server engine. The most import concept is that each player is seen as a entity. The entity is splict into three parts: client, cell and base. The data could be transferred between these three part. It is obvious to assume&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unity&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity is a client engine. It will create scene and UI for game. We put the connection logic between players into KBEngine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
